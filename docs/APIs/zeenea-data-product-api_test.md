# Data Product API

The Actian Data Intelligence Platform uses YAML descriptors derived from the [datacontract.com](http://datacontract.com) specification to ingest and update data products and data contracts.

These YAML files can be uploaded to the platform through a dedicated REST API. This API can be called from external tools like the [Data Contract CLI](https://cli.datacontract.com/), or the CI/CD pipelines, for instance, from a GitHub Action.

!!! important
    The Data Contract CLI requires the Python version recommended in the [Data Contract CLI](https://cli.datacontract.com/) documentation.

To use this API, an API key must be generated from the Administration, and the API key secret must be used in the API request header with the X-API-SECRET parameter.

There is a specific sequence of API calls to be made to create data products, as follows:

1. Send a POST request to this endpoint to get a URL for uploading the files:
    ```
    https://[your-tenant].zeenea.app/api/synchronization/data-product-uploads
    ```
    The API returns the following parameters:
    ```
    {
        "id": "ad8ac27f-692d-4174-8f84-2ebf00f0e099",
        "uploadParameters": {

            "headers": {
                "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms",
                "x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id": "arn:aws:kms:eu-west-3:306170271398:key/6bb87c4d-6e20-4e42-b3a9-7ad983d94e06"
            }
        },
        "maximumFileSizeInBytes": 52428800
    }
    ```
2. Upload the YAML files with a PUT request to the URL retrieved from the previous response, and by adding the headers “x-amz-server-side-encryption" and “x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id" also from the previous response. The data products and data contracts YAML descriptors must be compressed in a ZIP file. Notice that the ZIP file can contain several data products and data contracts.
    The endpoint returns an HTTP 200 status code if the request is successful.
3. Trigger file processing with a POST request to the following endpoint (where {id} comes from the first API call response. You will need to add the header `Content-Type` with the following value: `application/json` for this request):
    ```
    https://[your-tenant].zeenea.app/api/synchronization/data-product-uploads/{id}/process
    ```

    Use as an “id” the value returned in the first API call.

    You must also specify the targeted catalog in the body of the request:

    ```
    {
        "catalogCode": "default"
    }
    ```

    The endpoint returns an HTTP 200 status code if the request is successful.
4. Get the status of the processing to check how many data products have been upserted with a GET request to the following endpoint (where {id} comes from the first API call response):
    ```
    https://[your-tenant].zeenea.app/api/synchronization/data-product-uploads/{id}
    ```

    The endpoint returns the following information:

    ```
    {
        "result": {
            "processed": 1,
            "upserted": 1,
            "errors": []
        },
        "id": "17abafee-8dd4-4884-bd08-67260e59e13f",
        "status": "Processed"
    }
    ```

    Where:

    - **processed**: The number of data product YAML descriptors parsed by the platform.
    - **upserted**: The number of data products upserted.
    - **status**: The status of the job. The following are the possible values:
       - **Created**: The URL is created and expects an upload.
       - **Processing**: The files are being processed. 
       - **Processed**: The files have been processed.
